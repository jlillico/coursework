A high menthol content—like that found in the doTERRA Peppermint essential oil—distinguishes the best quality Peppermint from other products. Frequently used in toothpaste and chewing gum for oral hygiene, Peppermint also helps alleviate occasional stomach upset and promotes healthy respiratory function when taken internally.* Peppermint continues to be one of the best-selling favorites among doTERRA essential oils.','When ingested, promotes healthy respiratory function and clear breathing*\nPromotes digestive health when taken internally*\nRepels bugs naturally','Use a drop of Peppermint with Lemon in water for a healthy, refreshing mouth rinse.\nTake one to two drops in a Veggie Capsule to alleviate occasional stomach upset.*\nAdd a drop to your favorite smoothie recipe for a refreshing twist. \nPlace one drop in palm of hand with one drop Wild Orange and one drop Frankincense and inhale for a mid-day pick-me-up.'),(34,'Roman Chamomile ','Roman Chamomile grows close to the ground, reaching only up to a foot in height.

Originally from the Syrian capital Damascus, it is highly sought after for its many therapeutic properties. Before the sun crests the horizon in Bulgaria, workers can be found in fields harvesting the delicate bloom of the Rosa damascena. The labor-intensive production process has a very low yield; takes more than 10,000 freshly picked rose blossoms to produce only one 5mL bottle of Rose essential oil. Because the petals are so delicate, the distillation process must happen the same day that the flower is harvested. From this labor comes an essential oil known for its sweet floral aroma, beautiful and romantic. Diffuse Rose essential oil to uplift your spirits; the blooming floral fragrance brings about feelings of love, care, and comfort. Apply topically in daily skin care routines. Rose essential oil helps balance moisture levels in skin, reduce the appearance of skin imperfections, and promote a healthy-looking and even skin tone.','Helps balance moisture levels in the skin and reduce the appearance of skin imperfections\nPromotes an even skin tone and healthy-looking complexion\nSoothing and stress-relieving aroma\nRejuvenating, stimulating, and harmonizing','Combine one to two drops with the doTERRA moisturizer of your choice and apply to the face, neck, and décolletage.\nApply one drop directly to skin imperfections twice daily.\nDiffuse in the morning to promote feelings of energy and vitality.'),(36,'Rosemary ','Rosemary is an aromatic, evergreen shrub whose leaves are frequently used to flavor foods such as stuffings, pork, roast lamb, chicken, and turkey.

Both the wood and oil have been highly valued for centuries and Sandalwood has a documented history of many applications. It was traditionally used as an incense in religious ceremonies and for enhancing meditation, and the Egyptians used sandalwood for embalming. Sandalwood is very beneficial to the skin; it can help reduce the appearance of skin imperfections and it promotes a healthy, smooth complexion.

The main chemical component in Wintergreen, methyl salicylate, is used in topical creams and massage blends because of its soothing properties. In fact, Wintergreen and Birch are the only plants in the world that contain methyl salicylate naturally. As a flavoring, small amounts of Wintergreen are used in candies, toothpaste, and chewing gum.
